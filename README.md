### USER STORIES


As a researcher, I would like to view the questionnaires from the countries which are in a foreign language , so I need a program to provide the correct translation of each question.

As a client, I want to collect the answers of the questionnaires written in different languages so that I can easily match the same or similar questions of different languages.



Flow Steps:
1. Scrape the annual questionnaires from each country from the EUROSTAT website
2. Translate the questions by Google translator, match the same or similar question of different languages through keywords identification and statistical lexical matching.
3. Construct and populate a multilingual question database.
4. Upload and make the results available on the web.
